# BioKey-Keystrokes-dynamics-for-continuous-user-authentication
Keystroke dynamics can be used to analyze how users type and interact by measuring various
aspects of keyboard input gestures. Previous work demonstrated user authentication feasibility
using keystroke dynamics. Our project considers various machine learning and deep learning
techniques like CNN and RNN based on free-text keystroke features.

* In this repository you can find the research paper that describes the networks and the data preprocessing that we have done. 
* In addition the document "users guide..." descibes how to use the notebooks and scripts that we wrote.
